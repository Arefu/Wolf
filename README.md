# Wolf


Wolf is a collection of tools that allow you to edit content for [Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/480650/YuGiOh_Legacy_of_the_Duelist/) on PC.

There are no present or future plans to port any of these tools to allow editing content from the Play Station 4 or Xbox One, if anyone else feels upto it, by all means! I've documentated everything I know in the Wiki so feel free to check it out on there.
Even with me saying there are no plans, if someone can provide a legal way to obtain a disk image, I may take a look and see if these tools can be adjusted.

If you're looking for "Engine Research" or File Type layout information check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Arefu/Wolf/wiki).

If you're wanting support or just to chat, the Discord for this project can be found [here](https://discord.gg/a4Ync3M ).

If you're wondering where you start to use these tools, tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/Arefu/Wolf/wiki/How-To)


I have made all of these programs using [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) you will need to install [.NET 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/download/details.aspx?id=48130) or higher if you plan on building or running these tools.
The C++ projects are built targetting 10.0.15063.0, I am using Windows 10 Build 1709. If you don't know how to compile anything you can find development builds [here](https://github.com/Arefu/Wolf/tree/master/bin) They might be buggy or not work at all as these are builds I publish whenever I push code changes.
The C++ also require [Microsoft's Detour](https://github.com/microsoft/detours/) package, I've included a precompiled version, all rights belong to Microsoft and assocaited parties mentioned on the repo for their project.

The game and all its assets are the property of Other Ocean Interactive and or Konami Digital Entertainment.

Please keep that in mind before you go using them online to gain unfair advantages or ruining the game experince for other players.
